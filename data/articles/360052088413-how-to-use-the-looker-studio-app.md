# How to Use the Looker Studio App

### In this article, we'll show how to display Google Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) information on your digital signs with OptiSigns.

- [What You'll Need](#WhatYouNeed)
- [Creating a Looker Studio App](#CreatingApp)
- [Deploying a Looker Studio App](#DeployingApp)

With the Looker app, it's possible to display near real-time dashboards of information, allowing simple visualization of data. These dashboards can be customized then communicated throughout the company via digital signage.

Let's get started.

## Creating Your Looker Studio App

Once you have your report set up the way you'd like to display it, hit **Share**, and make sure the report is set to **Public:**

This allows it to be set up, and is necessary for it to display.

Now click **Edit**:

Now go to **File → Embed report**.

Now you should be on the **Embed Report** screen. Click **Enable embedding**, then make sure it is displaying an Embed Code. Change your **Width** and **Height** to match the resolution of the display you plan to use as a digital sign - we generally recommend 1920x1080 if you're unsure - then click **Copy to Clipboard.**

Next, go to the OptiSigns portal. Go to **Assets → Add Asset → Apps.**

Now you can set up your Looker Studio app:

- **Name -** The name of your Looker Studio asset. This is for organizational purposes within OptiSigns only and will not display on your screens.
- **Embed Code** **-** The Embed Code you retrieved a moment ago should be pasted into this field.
- **Update Interval -** How often OptiSigns will ping your Embed URL to update the data displayed on it. This is measured in seconds.

| **NOTE** |
| The Preview at this stage may display oddly. This is ok. We recommend pushing your Looker Studio app to a real screen for proper testing. Afterward, we can come back to this and alter the Width and Height elements if they need adjusting. |

Now, hit **Save**. You'll have created a Looker Studio app.

## Deploying a Looker Studio App

You can deploy your new Looker Studio app as an individual asset, or as part of a [Split Screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573-How-to-Create-and-Use-the-Split-Screen-App).

To get your new Looker Studio asset to a screen, go to the **Screens** tab, then click the screen you want to assign it to.

This brings up the **Edit Screen** tab:

![image](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48745429546643)

Here, select **Asset** under Content type, then hit **Change** next to Selected Asset.

Then, select your created Looker Studio Asset:

Now hit **Save**. Your Looker Studio asset will now display on screen.

| **NOTE** |
| You may need to alter the Width and Height on the Embed Code to get it to display exactly the way you want it. Be sure to push it to the intended screen first to test it - the Preview sometimes looks odd. |

You can also deploy it as part of a split screen, allowing you to show other assets at the same time. See how in our [Split Screen app article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573-How-to-Create-and-Use-the-Split-Screen-App) It can also be displayed in a Playlist or Schedule.
